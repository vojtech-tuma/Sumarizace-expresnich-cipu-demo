This zip file contains the library files for the exon array
analysis software. These are for the Mouse Exon 1.0 ST array
and are the v1 release version of the library files. The
two primary files, the clf and pgf files, contain a superset
of information that was formerly found in the cdf file.

  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/MoEx-1_0-st-v1.clf:
	CEL Layout File which indicates the location of 
	each probe within the CEL matrix

  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/MoEx-1_0-st-v1.pgf:
	Probe Group File indicates the groupings of probes 
	into probesets. 

The bgp folder contains BackGround Probe files which are 
used by bruce-probe-summarize along with the PM-GCBG
intensity method. The BackGround Probe file lists the 
probe IDs for the background probes for use with the
PM-GCBG intensity method. 

  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/bgp/antigenomic.bgp:
	These particular background probes were 
	selected based on the lack of sequence 
	matches to a number of different genomes.

  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/bgp/genomic.bgp:
	These particular background probes were selected 
	using the standard Affymetrix probe selection 
	software for regions of the mouse genome which 
	only had a genscan suboptimal exon prediction. 
	Furthermore, the probes in this file are the 
	mismatch probes from these genscan suboptimal-only 
	probesets.

The following files are lists of probeset IDs which can
be used by the exon array analysis software to restrict
the analysis to specific probesets. Use the 
--probeset-ids=<filename> option to bruce-probe-summarize
(or the probeset list text box in the GUI workflow) in
conjunction with these files.

  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/probeset-list/control.affx.txt:
	The standard AFFX control probesets. There are 
	antisense target versions for the bacterial
	spikes and sense target versions for the
	poly-A spikes.
  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/probeset-list/main.txt:
	Probesets for the primary content of the chip.
  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/probeset-list/normgene.exon.txt:
	Exon based probesets for the normalization
	control genes.
  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/probeset-list/normgene.intron.txt:
	Intron based probesets for the normalization
	control genes.
  - MoEx-1_0-st-v1/probeset-list/rescue.FLmRNA.unmapped.txt:
	Probesets for full-length sequences which did
	not map to the genome.

The non-validated text/binary CDF files are provided for
convenience, but are not supported.

FILE FORMATS:


PGF (Probe Group File Format): This file is a tab separated text file which has
information about how probes are arranged into probe sets. Lines starting with
a '#%' indicate a command tag. These lines must appear at the top of the file.
They are followed by a 'key=value' syntax and are used to embed header
information into the PGF file. Lines that start with a '##' are comments. These
lines are ignored by the PGF parser. Comments can be used by the user to embed
textual information or to comment out data that they don't want to be used.
What makes a PGF file different from a more typical tab separated text file is
that there is a nested structure to it. Specifically, the leading whitespace
for the data lines is significant as it indicates parent/child relationships.
For instance a line describing a probe set has no leading white space. A line
describing an atom (ie probe pair for expression) has a single tab leading
whitespace and a line describing a probe has two leading tabs. The atoms for a
given probe set are listed following the probe set line and the probes for an
atom are listed following the atom line. Special command tags are used to
describe the content in the data lines. The '#%header0=' command tag lists the
column names for the probe set lines. The '#%header1=' command tag lists the
column names for the atom lines. The '#%header2=' command tag lists the column
names for the probe lines. The specific columns in a pgf file can vary. Unlike
CDF files, the probe set, atom, and probe are all associated with a unique ID;
also, there is no x/y coordinate information for where the probes are on the
chip. (That information is in the CLF file.) Here are the columns and their
descriptions for the contents of the MoEx-1_0-st-v1 PGF file:

   - probeset_id: the probe set identifier. unique over the chip, but not
                  necessarily unique over all chip designs.
   - type: the type(s) or class(s) that a probeset, atom, and/or probe
           belongs to. See below for more details.
   - atom_id: the atom identifier. unique over the chip, but
              not necessarily unique over all chip designs.
   - probe_id: the probe identifier. unique over the chip, but
               not necessarily unique over all chip designs.
   - gc_count: the number of G/C bases in the probe
   - probe_length: the length of the probe
   - interrogation_position: the position of the mismatch base (even though
		most of the probesets on this chip design lack a mismatch
		probe, the center base, 13th, is still listed as the
		interrogation position)
   - probe_sequence: the sequence of the probe

Some of the header tags you may encounter in the PGF file:

   - #%pgf_version: PGF file format version 
   - #%chip_type: The chip type expected in the CEL files. Multiple
		chip_type lines may be listed when there are multiple
		GCOS library files for a given chip design
   - #%lib_set_name: The name of the library file set. Generally
		there will be one lib_set_name per chip design.
   - #%lib_set_version: The version of the content for the 
		lib_set_name.
   - #%create_date: The date that the PGF file was created
   - #%header0: Probeset header
   - #%header1: Atom header
   - #%header2: Probe header

When present, the clf_lib_set_name and clf_lib_set_version tags indicate
which CLF file is referenced by the PGF file. When absent, it is assumed
that the CLF file has the same lib_set_name and lib_set_version as the
PGF file.

Probeset types as reported in the PGF file:

  What type of target does the probeset interrogate (a
  single probeset may be associated with more than one):
    - main: probeset is part of the main design
    - control->affx: probeset is a standard AFFX control
    - control->chip: probeset is a chip control
    - control->bgp->antigenomic: probeset contains background
	probes (antigenomic background probes)
    - control->bgp->genomic: probeset contains background
	probes (genomic background probes)
    - normgene->exon: probeset is from an exonic region
	of a normalization control gene
    - normgene->intron: probeset is from an intronic region
	of a normalization control gene
    - rescue->FLmRNA->unmapped: probeset consists of probes
	tiled across an mRNA transcript which either
	didn't align to the genome, or aligned poorly

Probe (not probeset) types as reported in the PGF file:

  What type of sample target is interrogated by the probeset:
    - at: antisense target probe
    - st: sense target probe

  Perfect match or mismatch probe:
    - pm: perfect match probe
    - mm: mismatch probe

  Internal Control Probe Types:
    - blank
    - generic
    - jumbo-checkerboard
    - thermo 
    - trigrid 

The Affx::WTA::ParsePGF perl module should be used to interface with the PGF
files. This module is in the process of being rewritten in C++ and will 
probably be added to the File Parser SDK sometime in the future.

CLF (CEL Layout File Format): This file is a tab separated text file which has
information about where probes are in the CEL file. The file has the same command
tag ('#%') and comment ('##') syntax of the PGF file. In essence, the file
format (syntax) of the CLF and PGF files are identical. The CLF file lacks any
nested relationships; thus there is only a single header tag in the CLF file.
The data lines in the CLF file contain the probe identifier and the x/y
coordinate of the probe within the CEL file. This file format may be replaced
by a binary format in the future.

Some of the header tags you may encounter in the CLF file:

   - #%clf_format_version: CLF file format version
   - #%chip_type: The chip type expected in the CEL files
   - #%lib_set_name: The name of the library file set. Generally
		there will be one lib_set_name per chip design.
   - #%lib_set_version: The version of the content for the 
		lib_set_name.
   - #%create_date: The date that the PGF file was created
   - #%header0: header for the content of the CLF file (probe_id, x, y) 
   - #%rows: number of feature rows in the chip design
   - #%cols: number of feature columns in the chip design
   - #%sequential: Indicates that the probe_ids are sequential, column major
		order, starting at the value of this tag. When set, this
		allows the software to use a simple functional transformation
		based on the row and col count to translate probe ids to
		x/y coordinates. If not set, the software will need to read
		and hash the entire contents of the CLF file.

The Affx::WTA::ParseCLF perl module should be used to interface with the CLF
files. This module is in the process of being rewritten in C++ and will
probably be added to the File Parser SDK sometime in the future.

BGP (Background Probe File Format) and Probeset List Files: The BGP is 
and probeset list files are in a tab separated text file format extended
with comments ('##') and tags ('#%').  Similar tags to those found in the 
PGF and CLF files will be present. 

The Affx::WTA::ParseTSV perl module is a parser for handling generic
tab separated text files allowing for the meta tags and comments. This
module should be used to interface with BGP files (as well as the TSV 
files). This module is in the process of being rewritten in C++ and will
probably be added to the File Parser SDK sometime in the future.
